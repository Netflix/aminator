# log_dir: destination for debug log files. Debug logs are interesting as they include all the
# gory details of the aminate execution. Debug {logfile} names are constructued using the
# command-line package and AMI suffix parameters and take the form: {package}-{suffix}.log

# log_url_prefix: should include two formatting replacement fields to be replaced
# with the public dns name (or ip address if in vpc) of the instance where aminate
# is executed and the detailed log.

# boto_logdir: Directory where boto debug logs will be written. Log file paths take this form:
# {boto_logdir}/{boto}-{logfile}
#
# These logs can be quite verbose and will contain the account key. Therefore, boto debug logs
# will be written only when the '-D' aminate option is passed and if boto_logdir is set with
# an existing directory.
