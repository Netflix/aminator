aminator.plugins
================
plugin support for aminator

Aminator currently provides the following major plugin points:
- clouds (interfaces to cloud providers)
- block device allocators (components that reserve and provide OS devices to volume managers)
- volume managers (components that attach cloud volumes and prepare them for amination)
- provisioners (components that deploy applications into the volumes provided by volume managers)
- finalizers (components that tag and register the resultant image)

Plugins may be discovered through setuptools/distribute's entry_points mechanism
or registered by placing modules on a configurable plugin path for discovery.
